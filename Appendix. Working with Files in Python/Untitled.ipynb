       "'Chapter I.\\n\\nMy father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\\n\\nI give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, “Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.\\n\\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\\n\\n“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”\\n\\nA fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\\n\\n“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it, sir.”\\n\\n“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”\\n\\n“Pip, sir.”\\n\\n“Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”\\n\\n“Pip. Pip, sir.”\\n\\n“Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”\\n\\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\\n\\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.'"

       "'CHAPTER I\\nTHE ONE THING NEEDFUL\\n\\n\\n‘NOW, what I want is, Facts.  Teach these boys and girls nothing but\\nFacts.  Facts alone are wanted in life.  Plant nothing else, and root out\\neverything else.  You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon\\nFacts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.  This is the\\nprinciple on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle\\non which I bring up these children.  Stick to Facts, sir!’\\n\\nThe scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the\\nspeaker’s square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring\\nevery sentence with a line on the schoolmaster’s sleeve.  The emphasis\\nwas helped by the speaker’s square wall of a forehead, which had his\\neyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two\\ndark caves, overshadowed by the wall.  The emphasis was helped by the\\nspeaker’s mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set.  The emphasis was\\nhelped by the speaker’s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and\\ndictatorial.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker’s hair, which\\nbristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the\\nwind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of\\na plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts\\nstored inside.  The speaker’s obstinate carriage, square coat, square\\nlegs, square shoulders,—nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by\\nthe throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it\\nwas,—all helped the emphasis.\\n\\n‘In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!’\\n\\nThe speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present,\\nall backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of\\nlittle vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial\\ngallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.\\n\\n'"
