       "'CHAPTER I.\\nTREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE\\nCIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH\\n\\n\\nAmong other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons\\nit will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will\\nassign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,\\ngreat or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on\\na day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as\\nit can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of\\nthe business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is\\nprefixed to the head of this chapter.\\n\\nFor a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and\\ntrouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable\\ndoubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which\\ncase it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never\\nhave appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of\\npages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the\\nmost concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the\\nliterature of any age or country.\\n\\nAlthough I am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse,\\nis in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can\\npossibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular\\ninstance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by\\npossibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable\\ndifficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of\\nrespiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered\\nnecessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on\\na little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world\\nand the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.\\nNow, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by\\ncareful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors\\nof profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have\\nbeen killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper\\nold woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of\\nbeer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver\\nand Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that,\\nafter a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to\\nadvertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden\\nhaving been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as\\ncould reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\\npossessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer\\nspace of time than three minutes and a quarter.\\n'"
